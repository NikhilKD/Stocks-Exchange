    <h3>The Future of Investment - "Stock Market" </h3>
    <br>
    <div> “Stock Market” -The Future of Investment, this is a blog which will give you the idea of a fantastic upcoming
      platform of investment to earn money and some tips for beginner, intermediate and expert in the field of
      investment.
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="image-1"><img src="image 1.png" alt=""></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div>As the title itself says that this blog is basically on “Stock Market- The Future of Investment”. So many of
      you would have listened to this term before, "Stock Market" so <strong><em>What is the stock market? How can we
          invest to earn money?</strong></em> All your queries and doubts will be resolved here. The main motive of this
      blog is to teach more and more people about the Stock Market.
      <br>
      <br>
      Please read the blog carefully. So let's begin.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4 id="one">What is Stock Market?</h4>
      <br>
      A <strong><em>stock market</strong></em> or </strong></em>share market</strong></em> is a collection or let's say
      a market of buyers and sellers of shares which acts for <strong><em>ownership</strong></em> claims on businesses.
      You can understand this by buying some part of the whole.<br>
      A stock market is an exchange where brokers and traders can <strong><em>buy</strong></em> and
      <strong><em>sell</strong></em> shares or bonds. Many large companies have their stocks listed on the stock
      exchange (stock market). This makes the stock more eye-catchy and thus, more attractive to many investors. The
      conversation may also act as a mediator of settlement. These and other stocks may also be traded "over the
      counter", that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange
      in different countries, to attract international investors.

    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="image-2"><img src="image 2.png" alt=""></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div id="two"><strong><em>Before starting, I would like to clear some of the myths of the stock
          market.</strong></em>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Usually people think that stock market is about gambling.</li>
        <li>Also, people do fear to invest in the stock market because they think that it’s precarious, requires an
          excellent knowledge of finance.</li>
        <li>A considerable sum of amount is needed in the stock market, to earn money. </li>
      </ul>
      You will hear these sentences many times when you will try to enter the stock market. But the reality is that if
      the investments are being made by doing some research and knowing the fundaments of the company, it will surely
      give you high returns. Many great investors without having a finance background have done wonders in stock market.
      Putting the money after knowing the fundamentals will not be considered as gambling, it will be a full proved
      investment. Also many investors have started their journey from scratch i.e. without having a huge amount of money
      and have understood the power of compounding which have earn them profits.
      <br>So before entering in the market you should wipe up these thought from your mind.<br>
      Now the question arises that where can we buy the share. Is there anything that we can go to the company and
      purchase the shares?
      <br>
      The answer is an absolute <strong><em>NO</strong></em>.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em>In India there are two major shock exchange or say shock market first is the BSE i.e. Bombay Stock
          Exchange and second is the NSE i.e. the National stock Exchange.</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
    </div>
    <div class="image-3"><img src="image 3.png" alt=""></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div><strong><em>BOMBAY STOCK EXCHANGE (BSE)</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
      BSE is the oldest stock exchange of India, which was established in <strong><em>1875</strong></em>; it also Asia's
      oldest stock exchange. The BSE is the world's 10th largest stock exchange. More than 5500 companies have been
      listed in the BSE.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em>NATIONAL STOCK EXCHANGE OF INDIA (NSE)</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
      NSE is now one of the <strong><em>leading stock exchange</strong></em> in India. It was formed in the year
      <strong><em>1992</strong></em>. The reason of being India's leading stock exchange was to bring the revolutionary
      concept of dematerialization exchange with a fully automatic and electronic trading system. More than 1700
      companies have been registered in NSE.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em> What is the use of buying shares? or What is the benefit of buying shares?</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
      The answer could be understood by a situation, why we invest your money? The solution is for multiple investments.
      So where do we invest money in banks (FDs) mainly? At what rate do they give the interest..? Maybe at the rate of
      5 or 6 per cent or max to max 7 per cent. But in the case of the Bull market, the interest rate varies from 14 to
      18 per cent. So I think the answer is petty much clear.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em>Why do Stock Market has the bad name?</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
      Now many of you may wonder that the stock market is giving enormous result in multiplying your money but why most
      of the people do not invest in the stock market. Some of the main reasons are the scams that have happened in
      1986-1992 and 1998-2001 that shocked the whole market. These two incidents took the entire trust of the people
      from the market. Secondly, people who invest without doing the proper research of the company and bear the losses
      spread rumours in society.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em><span id="three">How to invest in share market?</span></strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
      There are a few things that you should know before you go to invest in the stock market. People get high returns
      in the stock market due to the effect of compounding. Before investing, the investor should have trading as well
      as a Demat (dematerialised) account. Trading accounts for the management of cash and equity, whereas a Demat
      account manages shares in a virtual form. And it is nowadays straightforward to open a Demat account online. Now
      let's see the essential requirements for opening Demat account online.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em>Things required are:-</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
      Bank statement, Aadhaar card, PAN Card, A Broker. These documents are basically for your identification and your
      income proof. After submitting these document within ten days, your Demat account will be ready for use.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em>Now let’s understand the stock trader</strong></em>
      <br>
      <br>
      Stock Traders are the one who trade equity securities. Their main goal is to buy and sell the shares of several
      different companies to gain profit for their clients.<br>
      These traders play an essential role in the whole transaction of buying or selling the stock. Also, they are the
      key person because they are the primary source which provides liquidity. Here liquidity means having a balance
      between the sellers and the buyers so that you can buy and sell shares quickly.<br>
      They have good knowledge about the market as they observe the trades, i.e. the demand and supply in the market
      also, they look to the past trends of the company and look into the fundaments so that there are fewer chances of
      loss.<br>
      Types of stock traders include day traders, swing traders, buy and hold traders, and momentum traders.
      <br>
      <br>

      <strong><em><span id="rules">guidelines</span></strong></em> of SEBI and the NSE, BSE trade which they want us to
      follow.
      <br>
      <br>
      1. Deal only with registered intermediaries - check the registration certificate of the intermediary with you are
      dealing. It allows recourse to regulatory action.
      <br>

      2. Beware of fixed/guaranteed returns schemes. Brokers or any of their representatives are not authorized to offer
      fixed/guaranteed returns on your investment or enter into any loan agreement to pay interest on the
      funds/securities provided by you.
      <br>

      3. Do not fall prey to emails and SMSs luring you to trade in stocks/ securities promising huge profits.
      <br>

      4. Ensure to fill all the required details in 'KYC' document by yourself and receive a duly signed copy of your
      'KYC' documents from your broker. Check for all conditions that have been agreed and accepted by you.
      <br>

      5. Opt for electronic (email) contract notes/financial statements only if you are computer savvy and have an email
      account of your own. Don't ignore any emails/SMSs received with regards to trades done by you. Verify the details
      of the same and report a discrepancy, if any, to your broker in writing immediately.
      <br>

      6. Trade verification facility is also available on the NSE website.
      <br>
      7. Check the frequency of accounts settlement opted for and verified your monthly/quarterly settlement statements.
      You should bring any discrepancies observed therein should be brought to the notice of your broker in writing
      immediately.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong><em><span id="five">Mistakes done by beginners</span></strong></em>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Listening to others while buying the company share.</li>
        <li>Investing by not seeing the trends of how the company’s share is performing.</li>
        <li>Sell as soon as the market goes down and buy when the shares are at their peak.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      These were the common mistakes done by me also. Please don’t commit these mistakes. Always believe in yourself
      that you are doing the right thing. Always see the trend how the companies are performing for at least 5 years.
      Try to buy share when the price is undervalued and sell when the market is running to gain enormous profit. Always
      try to make the investment for 3 to 5 years don’t get panic if the price are fluctuating within that period of
      time.
      <br>
      <br>
      <Strong><em><span id="tips"> TIPS AND TRICKS FOR GOOD INVESTMENT</span></em></Strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Try to buy the shares when their prices are undervalued.</li>
        <li>Hold the shares for at least 3 to 5 years.</li>
        <li>At beginning invest small amount to get some experience about how the market works.</li>
        <li>See the EPS and P/E RATIO of the company while doing the investment.</li>
        <li>When you buy a company’s share you are the partner of that company and you will be a partner of their profit
          and loss too.</li>
